 * When we start editing a documentation then it is not only one documentation but a whole net with

 * to provide selection context for the editing. If we would like to add references then we need to
 * which documentations to offer. These contexts are navigations that can offer documentation
 * properties to refer. It is the intellisense helper of the editing.
