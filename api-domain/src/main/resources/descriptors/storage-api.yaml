    ObjectReference:
      type: object
      description: |
        In generally if we have an object stored by a Storage then we might need to store some object references for this. 
        The related object references are more or less a list of URI or other identifier easy to serialize in every storage mechanism. 
        The Storage can publish events when the given object is changed. This can be filtered by this register. 
        The reference can be temporary so we can define a time limit when the Storage will remove the reference. 
        The relation can be renewed by adding it again and again. This object itself is managed by the ObjectStorage to store this in an 
        optimal way for the given storage mechanism.
      required: [uri]
      properties:
        uri:
          type: string

        referenceId:
          type: string
          description: |
            To separate the references from the same class the api can use this field to store specific data about the referred object.

          type: string
          format: date-time
          description: The expiration time for the reference.
