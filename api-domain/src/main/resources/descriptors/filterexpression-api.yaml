        The filter field model data contains a list of groups that form a tree structure for the available filter fields. It contains
        the groups of available fields and the workplace root list that conatins the already added filters. On the builder side 
        we refer the unique identifiers of the field lists and fields.

        The group is just a UI structure to define a tree structure for the available filter fields. In a group there
        is an ordered list of filter fields. The group can imply a parenthesis in the xpression or an exist node. Theoreticaly
        the groups are hierarchical but the pratcticaly it is not. The kind of the group defines what operation is available
        for the filter fields in the group. 
        DISPLAY: means thet we can choose an available filter field from the group and place it into the field
        list related with the current group or in any sub list except under an exist.
        BRACKET: The given groups defines a bracket. If we choose any of the fiels to add to a filter list then this imlicitely
        create a bracket node. It can not be added under an exist node.
        EXIST: The same as the BRACKET but with an exist node.
