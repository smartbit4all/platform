  title: Object api
  description: |
    The object api responsible for the domain object meta information including the object definitions
    and the relations among them. These objects are stored because the modules can contribute. The modules
    have their own ObjectApi that manages the storage and ensure the up-to-date view of the current data.
    The algorithms are running on the ObjectApi cache refreshed periodically.

            The qualified name of the type class in java. Like java.lang.String If we need to convert this type to any other platform then
            we need a conversion for this. If the type is primitive type (String, Long, Integer, etc.) then it is a value as is but if it has definition on
            its own then it is a complex type with inner properties as well.

            If the given property is mapped to a referred property then this is the name of the referred property inside the referred type.

      description: |
        The reference definition is a directed navigation between objects. Its name is unique inside the source object that can have only one

        enough to identify an incoming reference.

            reference. For example object:/com/smartbit4all/mydomain/model/MyObject/firstReference could be a calculated URI for a given reference.
            By default it could be a good idea to name the reference by the name of the property that contains the reference value.

            The descriptor of a property in a domain object. If there is a simple property then we have only the path. The path is a navigation path to
            identify the property in the object or in its contained objects. The path can be "parent" if the parent property is directly a property inside the
            object. It can be myContained/parent if it is the propery of the myContained object. The property must be an uri or unique identifier to be able to 
            access the object directly by its value.
            If we have an array the the array path contains the path of the array property in the same way. The array must contains uri / identifier values.

        The entry stands for an object in a collection that is branched. The entry can be a new one, modified, deleted or nop - unmodified.
        It has reference for the original and the branched uri sor we can follow tha two uri to access both.

        extension:
          description: |
            The extension property can be used for to construct extended object definition for the objectQualifiedName object. Like
            we can use the given property to create extended DocumentType.
          type: boolean
          default: false
        objectQualifiedName:
          description: |
            The qualified name of object the property belongs to. If it not an extension then we can use it to extend the given object. Otherwise it is the
            object that owns the given proporty.

    ObjectExtensionDescriptor:
      type: object
      description: |
        The extension descriptor defines the data layout of an object. The properties can be any DocumentProperty available as built in
        or extension properties. These properties are organized into layouts. The layouts are named to be able to identify the placeholder on the
        page. The extension contains the constraint and rule definitions for the given object let it be document or folder.
      required: [uri, name, layouts, properties]

        name:
          type: string
          description: |
            The extension name is a unique and unmodifiable identifier of the given extension. It is used to construct dynamic object
            definitions so it must match with the requirements of the an object name (ANSI characters with no white spaces)
        layouts:
          type: string
          description: |
            The layout definition for the object extension. The layouts are identified by their logical placeholder name that helps to identify
            the position of the given layout on the view.

        properties:
          type: string
          description: |
            The extension refers to included properties via reference but we store the properties mapped by their name to have a quick view about the
            available properties. If a property is included it appears in this list. If we place it into a layout then it is visible else it is invisible.

    ObjectConstraintDescriptor:

      description: |
        There can be different kind of constraints and they can be bound to events / related values. The event must be managed by the page or api logic of the given object.
        The values can be used to identify the situation when the given constraint must be applied.

            The condition to evaluate if the given constraint has to be enforced on the object. It can be a script that can be evaluated based on the extended object.
