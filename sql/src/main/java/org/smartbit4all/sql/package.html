This module provides the abstract structure of SQL expressions. Using these objects we can set up a standard insert, update, delete 
and select SQL statement. The instances of StatementNode forms an expression tree that can be rendered by the StatementBuilder to 
the database specific SQL dialect. This layer also manages the complex select statements as join graph.
